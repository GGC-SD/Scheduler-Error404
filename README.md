# Error404 - Faculty Scheduler output

# Description
As part of our Software Development I course with Dr. Mihu, we have been working on an interactive output for a Faculty Scheduler. In this output, the faculty is able to see their schedule and request changes for their schedule. The program also allows an administrator to handle any conflicts in schedules.
